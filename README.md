The **IoT Wardrobe Management App** is a secure platform that allows users to monitor their personal **environmental sensing devices** and manage their **wardrobe** efficiently. Through an authentication system, users can register **ESP32 devices**, track **real-time temperature** and **humidity** data, and visualize trends on an **interactive dashboard**. The app also features an **AI-powered assistant** that provides outfit recommendations based on sensor readings and weather forecasts. Users can maintain a **personalized wardrobe**, adding, updating, or removing clothing items. Security measures ensure that each user can only access their own data and devices.
